assalamualaikum

codename : `creatorb` [creatorbe]

Hi... yeah you there, welcome on my string! This is me, imma not much difference with an another programmer species :v haha! Nerd, Love computers, love coding and love everything an unit about them. I spend my day in front of a computer screen as I am reading, coding, debugging, or discussing coding practices and methods with other programmers. When I am not on there, I am reading islamic article, youtube, and another muslim source, or maybe had present in the mosque. Actually for all it really cool if you know something as deep and clear. I am deeply impressed when I see smart and beautiful code that does something I know is hard to accomplish. These are moments when I feel that we have only touched the surface of what we can do with computers, and I know that there is a simple solution to the current programming problem I am facing, I just need to get my head around it. With my spare time, I play around with new stuff, trying out new ideas or writing a patch or a bug report to some open source application I use, sometimes play around little hack with rogue style ;} , scanning open port of public ip, read and capture an transmitted packet data, login an public ip camera, and another fun yeah, yep its bad to talk more about that and you should not be emulated ;} zuahahaha. Most of my day has something to do with computers, until, of course, actually all of that maybe will make someone else think i'm strange man, psyco another side or an alien o,O hahaha then so forget it all, i still normal people B) sometime tired and sometime hungry.

Well yeah, fullname's Hasan Basri, everyday Life as a Software Engineer exactly muslim programmer, i'm passionate on mobile development currently on android programming, i'm really enjoy explore everything what im interested as deep as possible. Yup thats me, for more details you can visit my cv on [creatorbe.github.io/cv.html](https://creatorbe.github.io/cv.html) and dont be shy to get in touch with me.
